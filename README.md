# neural_computation_paper_1_Code 

The Code is for paper: https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01456 

The Code is prepared to run on Colab with GPU enabled 

The Code includes some simulations conducted in the paper and the code for other simulations can be easily generated from the provided code with small modifications 

The Code might generate different numbers with different randomly generated datasets, but the overall conclusions should be the same  

The differences between one-pathway and two-pathway networks may be small for some randomly generated datasets, and the differences are larger for some randomly generated datasets. For more significant differences between one-pathway and two-pathway networks, please see the Paper: https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01559 and its Code
